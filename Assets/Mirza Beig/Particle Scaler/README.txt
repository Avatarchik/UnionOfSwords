- PARTICLE SCALER:

Use this to scale ParticleSystem components either individually and directly, or in sets and embedded hierarchies.

Open up the editor window from the menu bar: Window -> Mirza Beig -> Particle Scaler. 

Simply select any ACTIVE GameObject(s) in the scene that have at least one ACTIVE ParticleSystem component in their hierarchy.

Then, set the desired scale factor and press apply. That's it. Scales multiply over each other.
Pressing scale twice with a factor of 0.5 will result in a final scale of 0.25 or 1/4 the starting size.
